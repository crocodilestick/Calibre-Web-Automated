## Why does it exist? 🔓

Calibre, while a fantastic tool for its age, has several problems when containerised, including its reliance on a KasmVNC server instance for the UI, which is near impossible to use on mobile and is relatively resource-heavy if you're running a small, lower power server like I am.

For many, Calibre-Web has really swooped in to save the day, offering an alternative to a containerised Calibre instance that's resource-light and with a much more modern UI to boot.

However, when compared to full-fat Calibre, it unfortunately lacks a few core features leading many to run both services in parallel, each serving to fill in where the other lacks, resulting in an often clunky, imperfect solution.

## Goal of the Project 🎯

Calibre-Web Automated aims to be an all-in-one solution, combining the modern lightweight web UI from Calibre-Web with the robust, versatile feature set of Calibre, with a slew of extra features and automations thrown in on top.

## 🚨 To users planning to deploy via Network Shares (particularly NFS) 🚨

- Calibre, Calibre-Web and CWA are all SQLite3 based applications and as a result **don't like being run over network shares (especially NFS)**
    - SQLite is designed as a lightweight, file-based database system, and it assumes the underlying file system supports certain guarantees about **file locking, atomic writes, and consistency**
    - **Network file systems (e.g., NFS, SMB/CIFS, etc.) often do not meet these assumptions, which can lead to issues.**
  - Some users are successful in deploying CWA across NFS shares however doing so **can produce a lot of hard to diagnose issues** that take time away from users with actual issues
  - **Therefore as of V3.0.0, deployments over NFS shares are "unsupported"**, meaning **you are free to do so**, but **support will not be provided for users facing issues**

### Network shares and SQLite WAL mode

- CWA optimizes SQLite concurrency by enabling Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) on local disks.
- Some network filesystems (NFS/SMB) do not fully support WAL or reliable file locking, which can cause intermittent "database is locked" errors or corruption risks.
- If you are deploying on a network share, set the following environment variable to disable WAL:

  - `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true`

This tells CWA to avoid enabling WAL on the Calibre `metadata.db` and the `app.db` settings database. It also disables recursive ownership changes (`chown`) performed by init/maintenance scripts to avoid permission issues on network filesystems. Default is `false` (WAL enabled) for better performance on local disks.

#### File watching on network shares

- By default, CWA uses Linux `inotify` (via `inotifywait`) to detect new files in the ingest folder with minimal latency and overhead.
- On network shares (NFS/SMB), filesystem events can be unreliable or unavailable. When `NETWORK_SHARE_MODE=true` is set, CWA switches the ingest and metadata watcher services to a polling-based watcher that periodically scans for changes. This improves reliability on NAS/network mounts at the cost of slightly higher I/O and up to a few seconds of latency.
- On Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS), the container runs on a LinuxKit/WSL2 VM and host-mounted paths may not propagate `inotify` events reliably. CWA auto-detects Docker Desktop at startup and prefers the same polling watcher for reliability.
- Advanced: You can also force polling regardless of share mode by setting `CWA_WATCH_MODE=poll`.

#### **Automatic Ingest Service** ✨
- CWA currently supports automatic ingest of 27 different popular ebook formats
- Users can configure the services behavior to ignore and/or have certain formats automatically converted to other formats in the Admin Panel

<!-- - A **Weighted Conversion Algorithm:** ⚖️
  - Using the information provided in the Calibre eBook-converter documentation on which formats convert best into epubs, CWA is able to determine from downloads containing multiple eBook formats, which format will convert most optimally, ignoring the other formats to ensure the **best possible quality** and no **duplicate imports** -->

#### **Automatic Conversion Service** 🔃
- On by default though can be toggled of in the CWA Settings page, with EPUB as the default target format
  - _Available target formats include:_ **EPUB**, **MOBI**, **AZW3**, **KEPUB** & **PDF**
- Upon detecting new files in the Ingest Directory, if any of the files are in formats the user has configured CWA to auto-convert to the current target format,
- The following **28 file types are currently supported:**
  - _.acsm, .azw, .azw3, .azw4, .mobi, .cbz, .cbr, .cb7, .cbc, .chm, .djvu, .docx, .epub, .fb2, .fbz, .html, .htmlz, .lit, .lrf, .odt, .pdf, .prc, .pdb, .pml, .rb, .rtf, .snb, .tcr, .txtz_
  - _Note: .acsm requires an additional Calibre plugin_

#### **Automatic Enforcement of Changes made to Covers & Metadata through the Calibre-Web UI!** 👀📔
- In stock Calibre-Web, any changes made to a book's **Cover and/or Metadata** are only applied to how the book appears in the Calibre-Web UI, changing nothing in the ebook's files like you would expect
- This results in a frustrating situation for many CW users who utilise CW's Send-To-Kindle function, and are disappointed to find that the High-Quality Covers they picked out and carefully chosen Metadata they sourced are completely absent on all their other devices! UGH!
- CWA's **Automatic Cover & Metadata Enforcement Feature** makes it so that **WHATEVER** you changes you make to **YOUR** books, **_are made to the books themselves_**, as well as in the Web UI, **making what you see, what you get.**

![Cover Enforcement CWA](README_images/cwa-enforcer-diagram.png "CWA 1.2.0 Cover Enforcement Diagram")

#### **Batch Editing & Deletion!** 🗂️🗄️
- Say goodbye to clicking that edit button again, and again, and again just to remove or edit a single series!
- To use, simply navigate to the `Books List`page on the left hand side of the Web UI, select the books you wish to edit/ delete and use the buttons either above the table or within the headers to do whatever you need!
- _Courtesy of [@jmarmstrong1207](https://github.com/jmarmstrong1207)_

![](/README_images/cwa-bulk-editting-diagram.png)

#### **Automated Back Up Service** 🔒
- Worried what will happen if something goes wrong during one of CWA's automated functions? Don't be!
- By default, the originals all files processed by CWA are stored in `/config/processed_books` though this can be toggled in the CWA Settings panel

#### **Automatic EPUB Fixer Service** 🔨
- Ever had it where you're super excited to start reading your next book but for some reason, Amazon's Send-to-Kindle service just keeps rejecting it? Well no more!

- Originally developed by [innocenat](https://github.com/innocenat/kindle-epub-fix), this tool corrects the following potential issues for every EPUB processed by CWA:
  - Fixes UTF-8 encoding problem by adding UTF-8 declaration if no encoding is specified
  - Fixes hyperlink problem (result in Amazon rejecting the EPUB) when NCX table of content link to `<body>` with ID hash.
  - Detect invalid and/or missing language tag in metadata, and prompt user to select new language.
  - Remove stray `<img>` tags with no source field.
  - Resolves several EPUB compatibility issues, such as UTF-8 encoding, hyperlink problems, invalid/missing language tags, and stray image tags.
- This **ensures maximum comparability** for each EPUB file with the Amazon **Send-to-Kindle** service and for those who don't use Amazon devices, has the side benefit of cleaning up your lower quality files!
- Enabled by default but can be toggled in settings.
- Files processed by the EPUB-Fixer service are by default automatically backed up to `/config/processed_books` however this can also be toggled in the settings.
- Bulk processing of whole library with progress tracking available in the Admin Panel
- Available via both the Web UI and CLI

#### **Simple to use Multi-Format Conversion Service** 🌌
- This utility gives the user the option to either keep a copy of the original of all converted files in `/config/processed_books` or to trust the process and have CWA simply convert and replace those files (not recommended)
- Full usage details can be found [here](#the-convert-library-tool)

![CWA Convert Library Web UI](/README_images/CWA-new-process-ui.gif)

#### **Additional Metadata Providers** 🗃️
- Users can now make use of [isbndb.com](https://isbndb.com/)'s huge database when fetching metadata for the books in their library!
- Access is being provided via [ibdb.dev](https://ibdb.dev/) thanks to a generous donation to the community by [@chad3814](https://www.github.com/chad3814)
- [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) is also currently in the process of being added to CWA as a Metadata Provider

#### **KOReader Syncing (KOSync)** 📖⚡
- CWA now includes built-in KOReader syncing functionality, providing a modern alternative to traditional KOReader sync servers
- **Universal KOReader Syncer:** Works across all KOReader-compatible devices, storing sync data in a readable format for future CWA features
- **Modern Authentication:** Uses RFC 7617 compliant header-based authentication instead of legacy MD5 hashing for enhanced security
- **CWA Integration:** Leverages your existing CWA user accounts and permissions - no additional server setup required
- **Easy Installation:** Plugin and setup instructions are available directly from your CWA instance at `/kosync`

#### **Enhanced OAuth 2.0/OIDC Authentication** 🔐
- **Auto-Discovery:** Automatic endpoint configuration via OIDC metadata URLs for seamless setup with providers like Keycloak, Authentik, Google, and Azure AD
- **Manual Override:** Full manual control over OAuth endpoints when auto-discovery isn't available
- **Field Mapping:** Configurable JWT field extraction for usernames and emails to work with any provider's token structure
- **Group-Based Roles:** Automatic admin role assignment based on OAuth provider groups
- **Testing Tools:** Built-in connection testing and validation to ensure your configuration works before going live
- **Enterprise Ready:** Support for custom scopes, multiple authentication methods, and comprehensive troubleshooting
- **📖 [Full OAuth Configuration Guide](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/wiki/OAuth-Configuration)** for detailed setup instructions

#### **Server Stats Tracking Page** 📍📊
  - Ever wondered how many times CWA has been there for you in the background? Check out the CWA Stats page to see a fun list of statistics showing how many times CWA has been there to make your life just that little bit easier
- A database also exists to keep track of any and all enforcements, imports, conversions & fixes both for peace of mind and to make the checking of any bugs or weird behaviour easier
  <!-- - Full documentation can be found below [here](#checking-the-cover-enforcement-logs) -->

![CWA Server Stats Page](/README_images/cwa-server-stats-page.png)

#### **Library Auto-Detect** 📚🕵️
  - Made to **MASSIVELY** simplify the setup process for both **new and existing users** alike
  - **New Users without existing Libraries:** 🆕
    - **No library? No problem!**
    - New users without existing Calibre Libraries no longer need to copy and paste `metadata.db` files and point to their location in the Web UI, CWA will now automatically detect the lack of Library in your given bind and automatically create a new one for you! It will even automatically register it with the Web UI so you can really hit the ground running
  - **New or Existing Users with Existing Libraries:**
    - Simply bind a directory containing your Calibre Library (search is done recursively so it doesn't matter how deep in the directory it is) and CWA will now automatically find it and mount it to the Web UI
    - Should you bind a directory with more than 1 Calibre Library in it, CWA will intelligently compare the disk sizes of all discovered libraries and mount the largest one
      - _CWA supports only one library per instance though support for multiple libraries is being investigated for future releases_
      - _In the meantime, users with multiple libraries who don't want to consolidate them are advised to run multiple, parallel instances_

#### **Easy Dark/ Light Mode Switching** ☀️🌙
  - **Switch between Light & Dark Modes in just one click from anywhere in the Web UI!**
  - Simply click/tap the 🕶️ icon on the  Web UI's navbar and switch between themes at your leisure

#### **Internal Update Notification System** 🛎️
  - Users will now be automatically notified of the availability of new updates from within the Web UI
  - Automatically triggered by a difference between the version number of the most recent GitHub release and the version installed
  - Set to only show once per calendar day until updated as to not be annoying
  - _Visible to Admin users only_

#### **Manual Library Refresh** ♻️
  - Ever had books get stuck in the ingest folder after an unexpected power-cut ect.? Well say goodbye to having to manually copy the books to be ingested back in and out of the ingest folder, simply press the `Refresh Library` button on the navbar of the Web UI and anything still sitting in the ingest folder will be automatically ingested!

#### **Auto-Compression of Backed Up Files** 🤐
  - Just before midnight each day, the CWA-Auto-Zipper service will automatically zip together all files processed that day.
  - Minimises disk space usage and helps keep back up files as organised as possible
  - __Enabled by default but can be disabled in the CWA Settings page in the Admin panel__

# How To Install 📖

## Quick Install 🚀

1. Download the Docker Compose template file using the command below:

```
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crocodilestick/calibre-web-automated/main/docker-compose.yml
```

2. Move the compose file to an empty folder (e.g. ~/docker/calibre-web-automated/docker-compose.yml). This will be used to store the server data and library

3. Edit the compose file using the comments to help, filling in your Timezone (optional) and desired binds

4. Navigate to where you downloaded the Compose file using `cd` and run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

And that's you off to the races! 🥳 HOWEVER to avoid potential problems and ensure maximum functionality, we recommend carrying out these [Post-Install Tasks Here](#post-install-tasks).

      - /path/to/your/calibre/library:/calibre-library
      # If you use calibre plugins, you can bind your plugins folder here to have CWA attempt to add them to its workflow (WIP)
      # If you are starting with a fresh install, you also need to copy customize.py.json to the Calibre config volume above, in /path/to/config/folder/.config/calibre/customize.py.json, see the note below for more info
      - /path/to/your/calibre/plugins/folder:/config/.config/calibre/plugins
    ports:
      # Change the first number to change the port you want to access the Web UI, not the second
      - 8083:8083
    # If you set CWA_PORT_OVERRIDE to a port below 1024, you may need to uncomment the following line:
    # cap_add:
    #   - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    restart: unless-stopped
~~~

### Explanation of the Container Bindings:

Please make sure all 3 of the main volume bindings are separate directories, errors can occur when binds are made within other binds.

- `/config` - This is used to store logs and other miscellaneous files that keep CWA running
  -  **New Users** - Use any empty folder (if you run into any issues, make sure the ownership of said folder isn't `root:root` in your main os)
  -  **Existing/ CW Users** - Those with existing Calibre-Web setups, map this to your existing `/config` directory containing `app.db` to ensure settings and users are pulled in
- `/cwa-book-ingest` - **ATTENTION** ⚠️ - All files within this folder will be **DELETED** after being processed. This folder should only be used to dump new books into for import and automatic conversion
- `/calibre-library` - This should be bound to your Calibre library folder where the `metadata.db` & book(s) files reside.
  - **New Users** - Use any empty folder (if you run into any issues, make sure the ownership of said folder isn't `root:root` in your main os)
  - **Existing/ CW Users** - If there are multiple libraries in the mounted directory, CWA will automatically find and mount the largest one - check the logs for more details on which `metadata.db` was utilised
- `/config/.config/calibre/plugins` - This should be bound to a directory containing a copy of your existing Calibre plugins. Configuration will be retained. (There is currently no way to configure plugins via CWA.)
  - In order for plugins to be registered and work, you must also copy the `customize.py.json` file from the Calibre plugins' parent directory to the correct config folder above, e.g. `/path/to/config/folder/.config/calibre/customize.py.json`. See the section below if you don't know where to find this file.
<!-- - `/books` _(Optional)_ Utilise if you have a separate collection of book files somewhere and want to be able to access within the container. For the majority of users, this is not required and mounting`/calibre-library' is sufficient -->
- `/app/calibre-web-automated/gmail.json` _(Optional)_ - This is used to setup Calibre-Web and/or CWA with your gmail account for sending books via email. Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Setup-Mailserver#gmail) if this is something you're interested in but be warned it can be a very fiddly process, I would personally recommend a simple SMTP Server

### Where can I find `customize.py.json`:

- On macOS, this file is typically found at `~/Library/Preferences/calibre/customize.py.json`.
- On Linux, it is usually located at `~/.config/calibre/customize.py.json`.
- On Windows, it is usually located at `%APPDATA%\calibre\customize.py.json` (typically `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\calibre\customize.py.json`). Older installations might have it in `C:\Program Files\Calibre\customize.py.json` or `C:\Program Files\Calibre2\customize.py.json`.

**Note:** If you can't find this file, it means you haven't configured any Calibre plugins yet. You can skip the plugins volume binding if you don't use Calibre plugins.


And just like that, Calibre-Web Automated should be up and running! **HOWEVER** to avoid potential problems and ensure maximum functionality,we recommend carrying out these [Post-Install Tasks Here](#post-install-tasks).

# Users migrating from stock Calibre-Web

- CWA has been designed to make switching over as easy as possible. To migrate your CW instance to CWA, simply:
  1. Stop your instance of CW if it's still running
  2. Whatever your `/books` bind was in Calibre-Web, should be your `/calibre-library` bind for CWA
  2. Mount the same `/config` folder in your Docker Compose that you were using for CW (or a copy of it to be extra safe)
  3. Mount the same folder containing your Calibre Library (the Docker Compose for the Linuxserver image of Calibre Web has this as `/books` by default)
- And then you're done! All of your users, settings ect. should be automatically carried over into your new CWA instance! Enjoy!
- If you run into an issue where the Web UI won't load, trying using the same port as you did for CW and then reconfiguring if you want to once you've got everything set up

# Post-Install Tasks:

## _Calibre-Web Quick Start Guide_

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8083 or http://localhost:8083/opds for the OPDS catalog
2. Log in with the default admin credentials (_below_)
3. Configure your Calibre-Web Automated instance via the Admin Page
  - A guide to what all of the stock CW Settings do can be found [here](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#basic-configuration)
  - Make sure `Enable Uploads` is enabled in `Settings -> Basic Configuration -> Feature Configuration`
4. Configure CWA to behave as you would like it to in the CWA Settings panel
  - Here you can turn certain features on and off, set your Target Format, which file formats should be ignored and which should be auto-converted ect.
6. Drop a book into your ingest folder to check everything is working and enjoy!

## Default Admin Login:

> **Username:** admin\
> **Password:** admin123

# Usage 🔧

## Adding Books to Your Library

- Simply move your newly downloaded or existing eBook files to the ingest folder which is `/cwa-book-ingest`
- Anything you place in this folder will be automatically analysed, converted if necessary and then imported into your Calibre-Web library if not in a format you have told CWA to ignore in the CWA Settings Panel
  - **⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️**
    - _Downloading files directly into `/cwa-book-ingest` is not supported. It can cause duplicate imports and potentially a corrupt database. It is recommended to first download the books completely, then transfer them to `/cwa-book-ingest` to avoid any issues_
    - Be sure that the books you are transferring to `/cwa-book-ingest` are owned by your user rather than root. Otherwise, permission errors may occur and may result in incomplete importing.
    - In the event you're expecting a book to be ingested and it hasn't been, use the "Library Refresh" button on the Upper Navbar to manually trigger the ingest process

## KOReader Syncing (KOSync) 📖⚡

CWA now includes built-in KOReader syncing functionality, allowing you to sync your reading progress across devices using KOReader. This feature provides a modern, secure alternative to traditional KOReader sync servers. Navigate to `http://your-cwa-instance:8083/kosync` in your browser where you'll find download links and installation instructions for the CWA KOReader plugin.

## Local Development Setup

1. **Build the image**  
   Edit and run [`build.sh`](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/blob/main/build.sh) to build a local Docker image of Calibre-Web-Automated.  See the script itself for usage details.

2. **Edit [`docker-compose.yml.dev`](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/blob/main/docker-compose.yml.dev)**  
   Update at minimum:  
   - `image:` → your image tag from step 1  
   - `volumes mounts` → paths for config, ingest, library, plugins  
  
 To have the app refresh dynamically in response to code changes, see comments in the  [`docker-compose.yml.dev`](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/blob/main/docker-compose.yml.dev)** for details and examples on "live-edit" mounts.

3. **Start the service**  
```
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml.dev up -d
```

4. **Log in & configure**  
   - Sign in with the [default admin login](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated?tab=readme-ov-file#default-admin-login)  
   - Optionally follow [Post-Install Tasks](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated?tab=readme-ov-file#post-install-tasks)-
