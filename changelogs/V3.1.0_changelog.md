# Release V3.1.0 Changelog

# Major Changes 🚀

## **NEW:** Split Library Support 💞

- As promised, all CWA features are now fully compatible with Calibre-Web's **Split Library Functionality**
- This enables users to store their Calibre Library in a a separate location to their `metadata.db` file
- To configure this, in the Admin Panel, navigate to **Edit Calibre Database Configuration** -> **Separate Book Files from Library**
    - The use of Network Shares **(especially NFS)** with this functionality is discouraged as they sometimes don't play well with CW & CWA's SQLite3 heavy stack. **Many users use network shares without issues** but there aren't enough resources to support those who can't get it working on their own

## **NEW:** Hardcover API Integration 💜📖

- [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) is now officially not only available as a **Metadata Provider**, but using **Hardcover's API**, **Kobo Shelves & Read Progress can now also be synced to a user's Hardcover account**!

- Current workflow is scraping a book by title, you can then use the resulting hardcover-id identifier to search for editions of that book, by searching "hardcover-id:". Edition results are filtered to exclude Audiobooks editions, and sorted by ebook then physical book.

- If a shelf in CWA is selected for Kobo sync, when a book with **id** and **edition identifiers** is added to the shelf, it will also be added to Hardcovers want to read list. As the book is read on the Kobo device progress is synced to Hardcover as well when pushed to CWA.

- To use **Hardcover** as a **Metadata Provider**, simply provided a Hardcover API Token in your `docker-compose` under the `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` Environment Variable
    - To enable Kobo sync, a Hardcover API Token must be provided for **each user** in each user's respective **Profile Page**

- **Thanks to [demitrix](https://github.com/demitrix)! <3**

## **NEW:** Greatly Improved Metadata Selection UI 🎨

- Demitrix was really on a roll the last couple of months and also contributed some really cool functionality to the Metadata Selection UI

![CWA New Metadata Fetch UI - V3.1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/refs/heads/main/README_images/V3-1-0_metadata_fetch_overhaul.png)

- Much more **Elegant & Readable** UI, both on **Mobile** & on **Desktop**
    - Improved CSS for the Fetch Metadata interface—making it easier and clearer for you to review and select metadata sources.
- **Individually Selectable Elements**
    - Say goodbye to having to having all of your book's metadata overwritten simply because you wanted a better looking cover!
    - As of **V3.1.0**, all metadata elements can be individually updated from multiple sources instead of the only option being to take everything for a single source!

- **Visual Quality Comparison Between the Cover Your Book Already Those Available from Metadata Providers**
    - Looking for a specific cover but not sure if the image file is low quality or not? As of **V3.1.0**, the **resolution of cover images** is now **displayed on the bottom right** corner of the preview, the background of which is **colour-coded to indicate** whether the available cover is of **greater, lower or equal quality** to the one already attached to the ebook!

- Thanks to **[demitrix](https://github.com/demitrix) for their contributions to this! <3**

## **NEW:** KoReader Sync Functionality! 📚🗘

- CWA now includes **built-in KOReader syncing functionality**, providing a **modern alternative to traditional KOReader sync servers**!
- **Universal KOReader Syncer:** Works across all KOReader-compatible devices, storing sync data in a readable format for future CWA features
- **Modern Authentication:** Uses RFC 7617 compliant header-based authentication instead of legacy MD5 hashing for enhanced security
- **CWA Integration:** Leverages your existing CWA user accounts and permissions - no additional server setup required
- **Easy Installation:** Plugin and setup instructions are available directly from your CWA instance at `/kosync`
- Provided by **[sirwolfgang](https://github.com/sirwolfgang)! <3**

## **NEW:** Support for the Latest Versions of Calibre, even on devices with older Kernels! 🆕🎉

- **ABI tag from the extracted libQt6\* files removed to allow them to be used with older kernels**
- Adds `binutils` to install `strip` for calibre-included Dockerfile.
strip libQt6*.so files of the ABI tag so that they can work with older kernels (harmless for newer kernels).
These libraries appear to still contain fallbacks for any missing syscalls that calibre might use.
add .gitattributes to enforce LF checkout on .sh files (useful for those who build on windows)
- **Thanks to these changes, CWA now has much greater compatibility with a much wider range of devices & is able to keep up to date with the latest Calibre Releases! 🎉**
- Provided by **[FennyFatal](https://github.com/FennyFatal) <3**

## **NEW:** Calibre Plugin Support _(WIP)_ 🔌

- Users can now install Calibre plugins such as **DeDRM**
- The feature is still a work in progress but users with existing Calibre instances can simply bind their existing Calibre plugins folder to `/config/.config/calibre/plugins` in their `docker-compose` file

## **NEW:** Bulk Add Books to Shelves 📚📚📚
Contributed by [netvyper](https://github.com/netvyper), you can now select multiple books from the book list page and add them to a shelf in one go!

- New "Add to Shelf" button in bulk actions on the book list.
- Modal dialog lets you pick your shelf.
- Backend checks for permissions, duplicates, and provides clear success/error feedback.

## **NEW:** Better Docs Cometh - The Birth of the CWA Wiki 📜

- The documentation for CWA while for many enough, could really be better in helping as many users find the answers and information they need as quickly as possible
- Therefore We have started work on the [CWA Wiki](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/wiki) to strive towards this goal!
- While still very much a work in progress, submissions for pages, edits ect. are open to the community so if you stumble across something that seems wrong, missing or outdated, please jump in and change it if you can or let us know if you're not sure :)

# Minor Changes ✨

- The Ingest Automerge Parameter is now configurable in the CWA Settings Panel (thanks to [have-a-boy](https://github.com/have-a-boy)! PR #417)
    - Users now have the option of selecting their preferred **automerge** behaviour from the 3 available:
        1. `new_record` (Default)
            - Create a duplicate record, keeping both copies
        2. `overwrite`
            - Overwrite library copy with newly imported file
        3. `ignore`
            - Discard duplicate import, keep library copy

    - The next update will do a lot more to try and squash dupe issues once and for all but for now this solution should help a lot of people configure CWA to do what they need

    - Hover animation over book covers is now snappier and more modern

## Supporting the Project ❤️

If you are in a position to, donations no matter how small are really appreciated & really help to keep the project going. Currently all money that has been and will be received is going towards a Kobo device so I can finally help out with the development & testing of CWA's KoSync & Kobo specific features :)
