# Release V3.2.0 Changelog

# Major Changes 🚀

## **NEW:** Robust & Secure Authentication System 🛡️🔐

    - **LDAP:** Seamlessly integrate with Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and FreeIPA. New users can now be automatically provisioned upon their first login!
    - **Reverse Proxy:** Support for Authelia, Authentik, and Traefik ForwardAuth with configurable auto-creation of users.
- **OAuth Enhancements:**
    - **Redirect Host Configuration:** Solves the "invalid redirect URI" issues for users behind complex proxy setups (Fixes #663).
    - **Permission Inheritance:** OAuth users now correctly inherit all default permissions and settings defined in the Basic Configuration (Fixes #660).
    - **Generic OIDC Support:** Connect to any OpenID Connect provider with ease!
- **Security First:** Enhanced input validation, SQL injection protection, and comprehensive audit logging ensure your library stays safe.

## **NEW:** Enhanced Send-to-eReader Experience 📧✈️

- **Complete Control:** We've completely rebuilt the "Send to eReader" functionality to give you total control over how your books are delivered.
- **New Modal Interface:**
    - **Multiple Recipients:** Send a book to multiple email addresses at once.
    - **Ad-Hoc Sending:** Type in any email address on the fly—perfect for sending a book to a friend or a temporary device without adding it to your profile.
    - **User-to-User:** Easily send books to other users on your CWA instance.
- **Custom Subjects:** Users can now customize the email subject line (e.g., "convert") to trigger specific behaviors on Amazon's end (Thanks to **[marauder37](https://github.com/marauder37)**!).

## **NEW:** Performance & UI Overhaul 🎨⚡

- **Snappier Experience:** We've made significant optimizations across the board, including major JS rewrites and refactoring, making the interface feel much more responsive.
    - **Advanced Search Refactor:** Queries now fetch only the necessary data for the current page, drastically reducing memory usage and load times for large libraries.
    - **Hot Books Optimization:** Eliminated "N+1 query" issues by fetching all book details in a single efficient database query.
- **Thumbnail System 2.0:**
    - **WebP Optimization:** Converted all background images and thumbnails to WebP, reducing page weight by **97%**!
    - **Always-Active:** Thumbnails are now a core feature, ensuring covers load instantly even on large libraries.
- **Mobile UI Improvements:**
    - **Better Layouts:** Fixed numerous positioning issues in Dark Mode and improved the layout of book descriptions and login screens on mobile devices.
- **Book List Power Tools:**
    - **Bulk Actions:** Added "Select All" and "Unselect All" buttons, plus Shift-Click functionality to select ranges of books.
    - **Quick Actions:** Hover over any book to instantly Mark as Read, Send to eReader, or Edit Metadata.
- **Profile Pictures:**
    - **Live Preview:** See how your new avatar looks before saving.
    - **Auto-Resize:** Client-side resizing ensures fast uploads and optimal performance.
- **Quality of Life:** Added a handy **Show Password** toggle on the login screen.

## **NEW:** Next-Level Automation & Scheduling 🤖⏰

- **Internal Task Scheduler:** A brand new, robust internal scheduler now manages background tasks, ensuring reliability even across container restarts.
- **Tasks System Integration:** CWA-specific background tasks (like Library Conversion and EPUB Fixer) are now fully integrated into the existing Calibre-Web Tasks UI, allowing you to monitor their progress and cancel them if needed.
- **Auto-Send to eReader:**
    - **Fully Automated:** Newly ingested books can now be automatically emailed to your device!
    - **Configurable Delay:** Set a delay (1-60 minutes) to allow for metadata polishing before sending.
- **Toast Notifications:** Get real-time feedback on your scheduled jobs with beautiful new toast notifications in the UI.

## **NEW:** The Ultimate Kobo Experience 📚💜

- **KOReader Progress Syncing:**
    - **Native Sync:** Sync your reading progress from KOReader directly to CWA without needing a separate sync server!
    - **Book Identification:** Uses MD5 hashing for accurate book matching.
- **Annotation Syncing:**
    - **Two-Way Sync:** Your highlights and notes are now synced between your Kobo device and CWA!
    - **Hardcover Integration:** Sync your annotations directly to [Hardcover.app](https://hardcover.app/) (Thanks to **[wolffshots](https://github.com/wolffshots)**!).
- **KFX & KFX-ZIP Support:** Full support for importing and converting to the high-quality KFX format (Thanks to **[jgoguen](https://github.com/jgoguen)**!).
- **Dual-Format Thumbnails:** Automatically generates both WebP (for the web) and JPEG (for Kobo) covers, ensuring covers always show up correctly on your device.

## **NEW:** Enhanced File Management & Ingest 📂🛡️

- **Unified Upload Process:** Uploading books via the UI now routes them through the robust CWA Ingest Pipeline. This means uploaded books are now automatically validated, deduplicated, and converted just like books dropped in the ingest folder!
- **Configurable Duplicate Detection:**
    - **You Decide:** A new dedicated page allows you to configure exactly what constitutes a "duplicate" in your library (Title, Author, Language, etc.).
    - **Language Aware:** Books in different languages are no longer incorrectly flagged as duplicates.
- **Robust Ingest Processor:**
    - **Process Recovery Service:** A new startup service cleans up stale locks and orphaned processes, ensuring the ingest loop never gets stuck.
    - **Lock Mechanism:** Completely rewritten file locking prevents race conditions and "Failed to queue" errors.
- **Retained Formats:**
    - **Keep the Originals:** You can now choose to keep original file formats after conversion (e.g., keep the EPUB even after converting to KEPUB).

## **NEW:** Metadata Mastery 🏷️🧠

- **Smart Metadata Application:**
    - **Intelligent Replacement:** No more blindly overwriting good data! The new "Smart Mode" only replaces metadata if the new data is objectively better (e.g., higher resolution cover, longer description).
- **Provider Control:**
    - **Toggle Providers:** You can now globally enable or disable specific metadata providers to tailor your search results.
    - **Provider Hierarchy:** Drag-and-drop to prioritize your favorite metadata sources (Google Books, Kobo, etc.).

## **NEW:** Stability & Testing 🧪🏗️

- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** We've added over 130 automated tests covering everything from unit logic to full Docker integration. This ensures that new updates don't break existing features.
- **Python 3.13 Upgrade:** The base image has been upgraded to Python 3.13, future-proofing the application and improving performance.

# Minor Changes ✨

- **Kobo Metadata Provider:** Added Kobo as a first-class metadata source (Thanks to **[opswhisperer](https://github.com/opswhisperer)**!).
- **LitRes Provider:** Added support for LitRes metadata (Thanks to **[nstwfdev](https://github.com/nstwfdev)**!).
- **LSOF Upgrade:** Updated `lsof` to prevent hangs on systems with high file descriptor limits.
- **Port Override:** New `CWA_PORT_OVERRIDE` environment variable for easier networking setup.
- **Kubernetes Support:** Added Kubernetes deployment examples (Thanks to **[opswhisperer](https://github.com/opswhisperer)**!).
- **Documentation:** Massive updates to the Wiki, including guides for OAuth, LDAP, and Testing.

# Bugfixes 🐛

- **Ingest Locks:** Fixed the "Failed to queue upload" error caused by broken lock files.
